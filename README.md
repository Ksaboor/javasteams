#Java 8 Streams

    This program is a display of knowledge of Streams


#.filter()
    In the filter class instead of evaluing
    with a for each you use Java Streams API .filter()
    which uses the functional Interface predicate 
    to return a boolean value.

## What is a lambda expression in java?
    In programming, a Lambda expression (or function) is 
    just an anonymous function, i.e., a function with 
    no name and without being bounded to an identifier.
    
    In laymans terms it is a function with no name
    given as constant values, and written exactly in
    the place where it is needed, usually as a parameter
    to some other function.
